### Overview
This project aims to investigate food access and food insecurity issues in the state of Michigan, particularly in the Greater Detroit Area. The project will utilize several analytical tools such as Excel, Tableau, and R to conduct statistical analysis on the data collected. The analysis will include binomial logistic regression analysis, univariate and bivariate analysis, and other relevant statistical techniques. The findings of the statistical analysis can be used to inform policy decisions, community outreach programs, and other initiatives aimed at addressing these issues.
