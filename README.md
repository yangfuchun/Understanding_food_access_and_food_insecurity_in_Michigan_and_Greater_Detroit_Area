# Understanding-food-access-and-food-insecurity-in-Michigan-and-Greater-Detroit-Area

This is a group project in which we used Excel, Tableau, and R to do statistical analysis including binomial logistics regression analysis, univariate and bivariate analyais to understand the food access and food insecurity problems in Michigan and Greater Detroit Area. 

A summary of what we did in this project: 
1. Created maps on Tableau to show total number of individuals in each county that are Low Access for the state of Michigan and Greater Detroit Area 
2. Run binomial logistics regression model to see if census tracts are more likely to be deemed low access based on if they are urban, the proportion of the tract population that is African American, the population size, the proportion of the tract that are seniors
3. Presented Univariate Descriptive Statistics on food-insecurity related variabels, parental status, and race for MI overall, Wayne County, and Genesee County
4. Computed chi-squared analyses to analyze the relationship between race, parental status, and food-insecurity related variables 
5. Suggested policy reform to address the food access and food insecurity in Michigan and especially Greater Detroit Area
